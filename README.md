## Abstract
Loyalty programs are essential for boosting customer retention and driving revenue growth by encouraging engagement and influencing purchasing behavior. This study evaluates the effectiveness of loyalty offers and digital engagement metrics within a major grocery retailer’s loyalty program. Using merged datasets that include sales, customer segmentation, and online interaction data, we apply data analytics and predictive modeling—particularly multiple linear regression—to assess the impact of different offer types and engagement behaviors on campaign performance. Our analysis highlights key drivers of customer response at both the overall and business-segment levels. The findings support data-driven decision-making and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing loyalty offer design and distribution. By aligning insights with business goals, this research helps enhance customer engagement and improve the return on marketing investment.
